## 📂 Projects Included  

### 1️⃣ 🛒 AI Shopping Agent – Decathlon Automation  
- **Description:**  
  Built an AI agent that automates shopping on [Decathlon](https://www.decathlon.in/). The agent searches for specific swimming gear, selects the correct sizes, and adds them to the cart—all automated using LLM-powered web interactions.  

- **Why I Built It:**  
  - To explore AI agent frameworks and their practical applications.  
  - As a swimmer for 5 years, it was exciting to automate the shopping for my favorite gear! 🏊  

- **What I Used & Learned:**  
  - **Frameworks:** Browser-Use, Web-UI  
  - **LLMs:** OpenAI, DeepSeek, Gemini  
  - **Skills:** AI agents, Web automation, API integration  

- **Special Thanks:**  
  - 🦊 [Gregor Zunic](https://x.com/gregpr07) & [Magnus Müller](https://x.com/mamagnus00) for **Browser-Use**  
  - 🌐 [Alex (warmshao)](https://x.com/warmshao) for **Web-UI**
