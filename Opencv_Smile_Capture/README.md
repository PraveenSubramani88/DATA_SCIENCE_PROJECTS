# OpenCV Smile Detection

A simple Jupyter notebook that uses OpenCV to detect smiles in real-time via webcam. When a smile is detected, it automatically captures and saves a photo.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)

Install OpenCV with:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
````

## How to Use

* Open and run the `OpenCV_Smile_Detection.ipynb` notebook.
* Smile in front of your webcam to trigger photo capture.
* Photos are saved with timestamped filenames.
* Press **'q'** to quit the webcam feed.

**Output example:**

```
Smile detected! Photo saved as smile_capture_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.jpg
```

```
