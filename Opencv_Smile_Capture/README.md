OpenCV Smile Detection

A simple Jupyter notebook that uses OpenCV to detect smiles in real-time via webcam. When a smile is detected, it automatically captures and saves a photo.

Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV (opencv-python)

To install OpenCV, run:

pip install opencv-python

How to Use

- Open and run the OpenCV_Smile_Detection.ipynb notebook.  
- Smile in front of your webcam to trigger photo capture.  
- Photos are saved with timestamped filenames in the current folder.  
- Press 'q' to quit the webcam feed.

Example output:

Smile detected! Photo saved as smile_capture_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.jpg
